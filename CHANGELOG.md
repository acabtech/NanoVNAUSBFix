# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Firmware version
numbers track the upstream NanoVNA-H release; the project version tags are
independent (for example `v1.0.0` packaging upstream `1.2.50`).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-02

### Added

- Official firmware build: upstream NanoVNA-H 1.2.50 with the USB peripheral
  clocked from PCLK (`STM32_USBSW_PCLK`) instead of HSI48.
- Unofficial firmware build: the same clock fix plus a composite CDC + USBTMC
  interface exposing a SCPI command surface for omariglol's generic USB layer.
- `:VNA:` SCPI commands for sweep control, CW frequency, pause/resume, data
  reads and a full stock-shell escape hatch.
- Reproducible build script pinned to upstream tag `1.2.50` and tarball SHA-256.
- CI, release workflow, artifact verification and DFU flashing helper.
- Documentation: architecture, USB API, building, flashing, testing.

### Notes

- A CRS/HSI48 trimming experiment did not fix enumeration on the affected unit
  and is kept under `docs/experiments/` for reference only.
